		    question="Suppose an application uses only three operations:  insert(), find(), and remove().

     [a]  Under what circumstances would you use a splay tree instead of a hash table?

     [c]  Under what circumstances would you use an unordered array instead of a 2-3-4 tree?
     [d]  Under what circumstances would you use a binary heap instead of an unordered array?" 
		    gold="[a]  If you need inexact matches.  For example, if you want to find the item less than or equal to 5 that's closest to 5. Hash tables can only do exact matches.  (If exact matches are all you need, however, hash tables are faster.)
     [b]  If each single operation absolutely must run in O(log n) time.  OR If most operations are find()s, and the data access patterns are uniformly random. (2-3-4 trees are faster for these operations because they don't restructure the tree.  But splay trees do better if a small proportion of the items are targets of most of the finds.)
     [c]  If memory use is the primary consideration (especially if a 2-3-4 tree holding all the items won't fit in memory).
     [d]  None.  find() and remove() on a heap take worst-case Theta(n) time, and they're more complicated than in an unordered array.  insert() on a heap takes worst-case Theta(log n) time, versus Theta(1) for an unordered array.">
